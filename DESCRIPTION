Title: Fitting Frailty Models with the EM Algorithm
Version: 0.5.0
Author: Theodor Adrian Balan, Hein Putter
Maintainer: Theodor Adrian Balan <teddybalan@gmail.com>

BugReports: https://github.com/teddybalan/frailtyEM/issues
Description: Contains functions for fitting shared frailty models with a semiparametric
    baseline hazard with the Expectation-Maximziation algorithm. Supported data formats 
    include clustered failures with left truncation and recurrent events in gaptime
    or Andersen-Gill format. Several frailty distributions, such as the the gamma, PVF family
    and positive stable are supported.
