\title{Control parameters for emfrail}
\usage{
emfrail_control(eps = 0.001, maxit = Inf, opt_fit = TRUE,
  verbose = FALSE, fast_fit = TRUE, zerotol = 1e-04,
  opt_control = list(method = "bobyqa", itnmax = NULL, control = list()))
}
\arguments{
\item{eps}{Convergence criterion for the inner loops (the EM algorithm) for fixed frailty parameters}

\item{maxit}{Maximum number of iterations in the inner loops (the EM algorithm)}

\item{opt_fit}{Logical. Whether the outer optimization should be carried out. If \code{FALSE}, then the frailty parameter is treated as fixed.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. Whether to print out information about what is going on during maximization.}

\item{fast_fit}{Logical. Whether to go the faster route in the E step and calculate directly (when possible)}

\item{zerotol}{Lower limit for 1/frailtypar (variance in case of gamma / pvf). Below this value, the variance is taken to be 0 and the
EM is not actually performed. The log-likelihood returned by em_fit is that for the Cox model.}

\item{opt_control}{A list with arguments to be sent to the maximizer. Currently ignored, will be useful in the future.}
}

A list of arguments suitable for \code{emfrail()}!
