Hi! This is an `R` package for fitting semiparametric shared frailty models.
It is under construction currently, so expect (usually daily) updates.

To install, you will need `devtools` and be able to build packages on your machine. 
Just use:
``` r
devtools::install_github("teddybalan/frailtoys")
```

Where to start? Well, try this:
``` r
library(frailtoys)
?emfrail
```
