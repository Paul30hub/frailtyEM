This is an R package for fitting semiparametric shared frailty models with the EM algorithm.

I am currently the maintainer and developer, so any suggestions are more than welcome. The stable version may be installed from `CRAN`:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("frailtyEM")
```
and the development version from `GitHub`:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("teddybalan/frailtyEM")
```
The bulk of the documentation of the package can be found in the vignette. If the package is installed from `GitHub`, then the vignette is installed if the pacakge is installed like this:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("teddybalan/frailtyEM", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```
