Hi! This is an R package for fitting semiparametric shared frailty models with the EM algorithm.
To install, use:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("teddybalan/frailtyEM")
```

Where to start? Well, try this:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(frailtyEM)
?emfrail
```

Although the package is currently stable, weekly improvements are still being made and bugs may still exist. So... update often!

Soon on CRAN!
